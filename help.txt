How It Works
HTML Structure: The stopwatch has a display area, control buttons (Start, Pause, Reset, Lap), and a section to show lap times.

CSS Styling: Basic styles for layout, including centered positioning, button styling, and the display area.

JavaScript Functionality:

startTimer(): Starts the timer and updates the display every 10 milliseconds.
pauseTimer(): Pauses the timer.
resetTimer(): Resets the timer and clears lap times.
lapTimer(): Records the current elapsed time as a lap.
getShowTime(): Calculates the current elapsed time and updates the display.
formatTime(): Formats the time in HH:MM
format.
Usage
You can copy and paste the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into your respective files to see the stopwatch in action. Adjust styles and functionality as needed! Enjoy building your stopwatch application!
